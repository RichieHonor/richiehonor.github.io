*Description*
Here is shown how I generated the figures used in my recently published (2020) chapter in the book ["Plant invasions: the role of biotic interactions"](https://www.cabi.org/cabebooks/ebook/20203555905). There also contains a few figures that were not used in the final manuscript, but were part of the process.
